        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="assets/images/Micah_Lea.jpeg">
        <p>Micah is just beginning his coding adventure and is currently enrolled in Vanderbilt Universityâ€™s Coding Bootcamp. He is excited to gain knowledge, experience, and to be surrounded by top-notch instructors and students. </p>
        <p>He has been married to his beautiful wife, Candi, since November of 2015. Together, they have a dog, Maddie, and two cats, Cuse and Leona. Maddie is an Australian Shepherd-wolf mix; Cuse is an orange tabby who is obsessed with food and sleeps most of his day; and Leona is a one year old blind, Egyptian cat who wildly attacks her (usually) sleeping brother.</p>
        <p>Since his teens, Micah has sung and played guitar. His passion for music lead him to become a professional musician for several years and exposed him to live and studio sound engineering. Performing at the CMA Festival in 2015 as a backing vocalist and guitar player is one of his most notable professional achievements.</p>
